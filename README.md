# project4

This project we use sqlite and gcrypt to complete. We use the sqlite to store the password, username and the encrypted message. When the receiver log in, he/she can get the information that the message is waiting, but others who hasn't received the message can't see it. And the message we encrypted it in order that it is getten by others.
